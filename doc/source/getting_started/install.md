# Installation

The SDK is available as a NuGet package [AasCore.Aas3_1].

[AasCore.Aas3_1]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/AasCore.Aas3_1/

Change to your project's directory (*i.e*, the directory where your .csproj file resides).

Add the SDK as the dependency using `dotnet`:

```
dotnet add package AasCore.Aas3_1
```

The SDK should be now available.
You might probably need to re-start your IDE and re-build the solution for changes to take effect.
